        <div class="info2">
        <p>
            In 1995, traditional animation artists from Amblimation joined the new studio, which led to DreamWorks buying part of Pacific Data Images, a company specializing in visual effects, and renaming it PDI/DreamWorks in 2000. Both were software divisions and would merge later on.
            <span class="read-more">
             By then, DreamWorks had the traditional animators working for their animation department, and the computer animators worked on CG films. The same year, DreamWorks Interactive,a computer and video game developer and joint venture between DreamWorks and Microsoft, was founded.
